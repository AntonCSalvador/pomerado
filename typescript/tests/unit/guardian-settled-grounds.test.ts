// Failure modes covered: an execution refusal that rests on a fact the host already settled
// stands, so a read example the host lets run again is refused for lacking retry permission,
// and a read-only look-up of a confirmed write's own result is refused as a repeat of that write;
// the host's pushback lets a second write or an unrelated read through; and a refusal that
// keeps resting on a settled fact ends the build as a policy block.
